<p><span><strong>Institutional Policies and Instructor Procedures</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus Information:&nbsp;</strong>Students are responsible for understanding and adhering to the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>material presented in this syllabus.&nbsp; The instructor may update the syllabus at any time during the course.</p>
<p><strong>Student EMAIL</strong>: Yavapai College provides enrolled students with an official username@scholar.yc.edu email address. Yavapai College requires enrolled students to utilize the YC email system for official college-related communications. Students are expected to check their Yavapai College email account as directed by their instructor.&nbsp; For class specific communications, please use the Canvas Inbox.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENDANCE</strong>: Students are expected to attend and participate in all class meetings, group activities, laboratories, and field trips.&nbsp; A student who expects to be absent due to a school-sponsored activity must make prior arrangements with the instructor.&nbsp; A student who does not adhere to the instructor’s and College’s attendance requirements may be dropped/withdrawn from the course as defined in the Yavapai College General Catalog.</p>
<p><em>Call or e-mail if you will not be in attendance. No-shows will be dropped. Tardiness is discouraged.&nbsp; Excess Tardiness (more than 2) or being Tardy beyond 5 minutes is counted as an absence.</em><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>It is the student's responsibility to initiate a withdrawal from class should the need arise. I will withdraw you if you accumulate an absence within the first ten (10) days of class. &nbsp;Official absences are only valid with proper documentation by a certified doctor, approved by the instructor or campus administration (see academic complaint form below).&nbsp; Unofficial and Official absences are not eligible to earn attendance participation points.&nbsp; Attendance participation points are not awarded if you leave class early.&nbsp; Official absences can take the place of mandatory seat time.</p>
<p><em>No class points will be awarded if you are tardy or leave early, no exceptions.</em></p>
<p><strong>FOOD/DRINKS:&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Food is not allowed in the computer labs.&nbsp; Drinks may be brought but only in spill-proof containers - No alcohol allowed on campus</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19:&nbsp;</strong>All students need to be aware of and comply with the safety and operational protocols for COVID-19 while on Yavapai College’s campuses or centers. Safety protocols can be found at&nbsp;<br>this link: https://www.yc.edu/v6/college-police/covid-19/reentry.</p>
<p><strong>COURSE WITHDRAWAL</strong>: A student-initiated withdrawal deadline is established by the college. If a student has not withdrawn from a class by the deadline, the student will receive the letter grade earned in the course at the end of the semester; earned grades will be posted on the student’s permanent record. Remember, instructors cannot withdraw students. &nbsp;If a student has not withdrawn from a class by the deadline, the student will receive the letter grade earned in the course at the end of the semester; earned grades will be posted on the student’s permanent record.&nbsp; For specific dates, see Academic Calendar. &nbsp;Active participation in an online class is a measurable activity that requires a student to engage in materials and complete and submit some type of assignment.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.yc.edu/v6/registrar/calendar.html">Academic Calendar</a></p>
<p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong>:&nbsp;Honesty in academic work is a central element of the learning environment. It is expected that students will submit their own work. The presentation of work not created by the student as one's own or the act of seeking unfair academic advantage through cheating, plagiarism, the prohibited use of generative AI, or other dishonest means are violations of the college’s Student Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and violation of copyright and penalties for violation are available in the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yc.edu%2Fcodeofconduct&amp;data=05%7C02%7CStacey.Hilton%40yc.edu%7C885e04b5577543698cd308dbf825d363%7C6fe6a507e7074f10bb43b8544d88fc5d%7C0%7C0%7C638376613581212467%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ET%2FwHNHoa%2BxJIKQEBtfZQ9w3tU1Rx%2FUx4b%2F93BapPAs%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><span>Yavapai College Student Code of Conduct Links to an external site.</span><span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong>STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT</strong>:&nbsp;Respect for the rights of others and for the college and its property are fundamental expectations for every student.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yc.edu/codeofconduct">Student Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;outlines behavioral expectations and explains the process for responding to allegations of student misconduct.</p>
<p>Students are expected to respond and write in a respectful, professional, and appropriate manner in all forms of communication and when activities are assigned to create scenarios, discuss opinions, present on a selected subject, or post to the web board. Inappropriate language or objectionable material will not be tolerated and could result in disciplinary measures and/or a failing grade for the class.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Classroom Environment Statement:&nbsp;</strong>Disagreement within the classroom does not equal disrespect, you are encouraged to have different points of view, different opinions and values, however, it is required that students monitor their language within discussions. Racist, sexist, or homophobic language will not be tolerated. Consult the student handbook for college policies regarding these types of behavior.</p>
<p><strong>CIVIL DIALOGUE STATEMENT:&nbsp;</strong>Regardless of venue or delivery method, faculty must ensure and maintain an environment appropriate for higher education. To promote a positive educational experience, appropriate and civil communication is an expectation of all students. All communication must remain respectful. Language or behavior that is threatening, intimidating, harassing, defamatory, libelous, or obscene is unacceptable.&nbsp; Failure to abide by these standards may result in disciplinary measures.

<p><strong>ETIQUETTE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Etiquette refers to the generally accepted rules of behavior for communicating in both the face-to-face and the online environment (known as netiquette).</li>
<li>Be professional and careful with what you say or post in class. Express your thoughts clearly and concisely.</li>
<li>Be careful when using sarcasm and humor. Communications, especially online, are very impersonal and others may take your words as criticism.</li>
<li>Be courteous and respectful of other people. If you use abusive or offensive language, you may potentially be removed from your course.</li>
<li>Use common sense - is this message something that you want to be said or sent to you?</li>
</ol>

<p>Some examples of generative AI tools include but are not limited to: ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Stable Diffusion, Grammarly AI Writing Assistant, and Adobe Firefly.</p>
<p><strong>No Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allowed</strong></p>
